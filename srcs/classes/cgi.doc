AUTH_TYPE
	The AUTH_TYPE variable identifies any mechanism used by the server to
   authenticate the user.  
   For HTTP, if the client request required authentication for external
   access, then the server MUST set the value of this variable from the
   'auth-scheme' token in the request Authorization header field.
	AUTH_TYPE	  = 

CONTENT_LENGTH
	  CONTENT_LENGTH = body.size()

CONTENT_TYPE
   If the request includes a message-body, the CONTENT_TYPE variable is
   set to the Internet Media Type of the message-body.
	  CONTENT_TYPE = 

GATEWAY_INTERFACE
   The GATEWAY_INTERFACE variable MUST be set to the dialect of CGI
   being used by the server to communicate with the script.  Syntax:
	  GATEWAY_INTERFACE = CGI/1.1

PATH_INFO
   The PATH_INFO variable specifies a path to be interpreted by the CGI
   script.  
	  PATH_INFO =	"/usr/bin/php7.4" -> for php
					   "/bin/bash" -> for bash script

PATH_TRANSLATED
   The PATH_TRANSLATED variable is derived by taking the PATH_INFO
   value, parsing it as a local URI in its own right, and performing any
   virtual-to-physical translation appropriate to map it onto the
   server's document repository structure.  The set of characters
   permitted in the result is system-defined.
	  PATH_TRANSLATED = 

QUERY_STRING
   The QUERY_STRING variable contains a URL-encoded search or parameter
   string; it provides information to the CGI script to affect or refine
   the document to be returned by the script.
	  QUERY_STRING = 

REMOTE_ADDR
   The REMOTE_ADDR variable MUST be set to the network address of the
   client sending the request to the server. (= localhost)
	  REMOTE_ADDR  = localhost

REQUEST_METHOD
	REQUEST_METHOD  = method

SCRIPT_NAME
	SCRIPT_NAME = ./website/cgi/....

SERVER_NAME
	SERVER_NAME = localhost

SERVER_PORT
	SERVER_PORT =  8080

SERVER_PROTOCOL
	SERVER_PROTOCOL = HTTP/1.1

SERVER_SOFTWARE
	SERVER_SOFTWARE = webserv
